* Notes from Assignment Page
- This assignment will be using TDD and since this is your first experience with it, it could become overwhelming.
  - take your time, one step at a time
  - write a test, then make it pass
- Do your best to isolate every bit of application functionality from actual DOM manipulation bits
  - try your best to keep those things outside of the app logic
*** TODO Ship factory function
- ship will be objects that include their length, where they've been hit and whether or not they've been sunk
- you only have to test your object's public interface
  - only methods or properties that are used outside of your 'ship' object need unit tests
- ships should have a hit() function that takes a number and then marks that position as hit
- isSunk() should be a function that calculates it based on their length and whether all of their positions are 'hit'
*** TODO Gameboard factory
*** TODO Player
*** TODO domModule
* How to play battleship?
** Intro
- played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked
- the fleets are concealed from the other player
- players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships
** Description
- the game is played on four grids, 2 for each player
  - usually 10 x 10 grid, each individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number
- on one grid the player arranges ships and record the shots by the opponent(ocean grid), on the other grid, the player records their own shots(tracking or target grid)
- before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their ocean grid.
  - each ship occupies a certain number of consecutive squares on the grid, either horizontal or vertical, no diagonally or overlaping allowed
  - the types and number of ships allowed for each player are equal
- after the ships have been positioned the game proceeds in a series of rounds
  - in each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at
  - the opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship.
    - if it is a hit: the player who is hit marks this on their own ocean grid. The attacking player marks the hit or miss on their own tracking grid
      - if all the squares of the ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of the ship
      - if all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins
      - if all ships of both players are sunk by the end of the round, the game is a draw

- 5 ships each player
- 10 x 10 grid - 2 grid for each player
