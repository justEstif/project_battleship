#+title: Project: Battleship

* Notes from Assignment Page
- This assignment will be using TDD and since this is your first experience with it, it could become overwhelming.
  - take your time, one step at a time
  - write a test, then make it pass
- Do your best to isolate every bit of application functionality from actual DOM manipulation bits
  - try your best to keep those things outside of the app logic
