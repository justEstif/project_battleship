coordinates: [
  {1:null},
  {2:null},
  {3:null},
  {4:null},
  {5:null},
]

check if any of the other ships are at that coordinate
check if the coordinate array is of the length of the ship array
set ship coordintaes


ship -> take in length -> 

strike -> takes in number 
the receiveAttack -> would check if the coordinate is one of the ships
  > from within the ships gets the index -> adds one and passes it to the ship.strike
