coordinates: [
{1:null},
{2:null},
{3:null},
{4:null},
{5:null},
]

check if any of the other ships are at that coordinate
check if the coordinate array is of the length of the ship array
set ship coordintaes

ship -> take in length ->

strike -> takes in number
the receiveAttack -> would check if the coordinate is one of the ships

> from within the ships gets the index -> adds one and passes it to the ship.strike

the ship location and hits
locations = ["", '']
hits = ['', '' ,'']
